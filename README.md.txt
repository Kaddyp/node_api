1. pm2 ==> https://pm2.keymetrics.io/

2.  Run the npm shrinkwrap command ==> It will lock all dependencies versions within the file npm-shrinkwrap.json giving you control over
the dependencies versions of your project. This command is very useful in a production environment, where the versions need to be stricter.

3. "scripts": {
  	"start": "node app.js",
  	"clean": "rm -rf node_modules",
 	"test": "node test.js"
   }
The npm run clean command is an example of a global command from the bash, which internally runs the command rm -rfnode_modules to delete all files from the node_modules folder.

4. ORM library that aligns with your project requirements (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma)

5.  Why to install babel ==> The current Node.js version does not support ES6 perfectly, but we can use a module that emulates some of the resources from ES6/ES7 to make our codes better. To do this, we are going to install babel, a JavaScript compiler responsible for converting ES6/ES7 codes to an ES5 code only when the JavaScript runtime doesnâ€™t recognize some ES6/ES7 features.

To use all features from ES6/ES7, we are going to install the babel-cli and babelpreset-es2015 modules in the project, running this command:
## npm install babel-cli@6.5.1 babel-preset-es2015@6.5.0 --save

Now you need to link the preset babel-preset-es2015 to be recognized by the babel-cli. To do this, just create the file .babelrc with this simple code:
 {
 	"presets": ["es2015"]
 }

Update pakage.json and run command ==> npm start
"scripts": {
  	"start": "babel-node index.js"
},
